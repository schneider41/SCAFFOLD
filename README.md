# Accelerated Federated Learning Over MAC in Heterogeneous Networks

This framework is part of university final project, of developing new federated learning algorithm in presence of heterogeneous settings. The framework simulates the performance of new accelerated FL algorithm over different network configurations and data distributions, using variety of datasets such as MNIST and CIFAR-10.
